	abstract = {The current research explored whether perspective-taking increases willingness to engage in contact with stereotyped outgroup members. Across three studies, we find that perspective-taking increases willingness to engage in contact with negatively-stereotyped targets. In Study 1, perspective-takers sat closer to, whereas stereotype suppressors sat further from, a hooligan compared to control participants. In Study 2, individual differences in perspective-taking tendencies predicted individuals’ willingness to engage in contact with a hooligan, having effects above and beyond those of empathic concern. Finally, Study 3 demonstrated that perspective-taking’s effects on intergroup contact extend to the target’s group (i.e., another homeless man), but not to other outgroups (i.e., a man of African descent). Consistent with other perspectivetaking research, our findings show that perspective-taking facilitates the creation of social bonds by increasing contact with stereotyped outgroup members.},

	abstract = {Objective: To provide a scoping review of studies on empathy recognition in text using natural language processing (NLP) that can inform an approach to identifying physician empathic communication over patient portal messages. Materials and methods: We searched 6 databases to identify relevant studies published through May 1, 2023. The study selection was conducted through a title screening, an abstract review, and a full-text review. Our process followed the PRISMA-ScR guidelines.
Results: Of the 2446 publications identified from our searches, 39 studies were selected for the final review, which summarized: (1) definitions and context of empathy, (2) data sources and tested models, and (3) model performance. Definitions of empathy varied in their specificity to the context and setting of the study. The most common settings in which empathy was studied were reactions to news stories, health-related social media forums, and counseling sessions. We also observed an expected shift in methods used that coincided with the introduction of transformer-based models. Discussion: Aspects of the current approaches taken across various domains may be translatable to communication over a patient portal. However, the specific barriers to identifying empathic communication in this context are unclear. While modern NLP methods appear to be able to handle empathy-related tasks, challenges remain in precisely defining and measuring empathy in text.
Conclusion: Existing work that has attempted to measure empathy in text using NLP provides a useful basis for future studies of patientphysician asynchronous communication, but consideration for the conceptualization of empathy is needed.},

	abstract = {Based on a review of relevant literature, we propose that the proliferation of AI with human-like and social features presents an unprecedented opportunity to address the underlying cognitive and affective drivers of prejudice. An approach informed by the psychology of intergroup contact and prejudice reduction is necessary because current AI systems often reinforce or avoid prejudices. Against this backdrop, we outline unique opportunities for prejudice reduction through ‘synthetic’ intergroup contact, wherein consumers interact with AI products and services that counter stereotypes and serve as a ‘proxy’ members of the outgroup (i.e., counter-stereotypical AI). In contrast to human-human contact, humanizing and socializing AI can reduce prejudice through more repeated, direct, unavoidable, private, non-judgmental, collaborative, and need-satisfying contact. We illustrate the potential of synthetic intergroup contact with counter-stereotypical AI using examples of gender stereotypes and hate speech and discuss practical considerations for implementing counterstereotypical AI without inadvertently perpetuating or reinforcing prejudice.},

    abstract = {The promise of human behavioral simulation—general-purpose computational agents that replicate human behavior across domains—could enable broad applications in policymaking and social science. We present a novel agent architecture that simulates the attitudes and behaviors of 1,052 real individuals—applying large language models to qualitative interviews about their lives, then measuring how well these agents replicate the attitudes and behaviors of the individuals that they represent. The generative agents replicate participants' responses on the General Social Survey 85\% as accurately as participants replicate their own answers two weeks later, and perform comparably in predicting personality traits and outcomes in experimental replications. Our architecture reduces accuracy biases across racial and ideological groups compared to agents given demographic descriptions. This work provides a foundation for new tools that can help investigate individual and collective behavior.},

    abstract = {Large language model (LLM)-based digital twin simulation, where LLMs are used to emulate individual human behavior, holds great promise for research in business, artificial intelligence, social science, and digital experimentation. However, progress in this area has been hindered by the scarcity of real individual-level data sets that are both large and publicly available. To address this gap, we introduce a large-scale public data set designed to capture a rich and holistic view of individual human behavior. We survey a representative sample of N � 2,058 participants (average 2.42 hours per person) in the United States across four waves with more than 500 questions in total, covering a comprehensive battery of demographic, psychological, economic, personality, and cognitive measures, as well as replications of behavioral economics experiments and a pricing survey. The final wave repeats tasks from earlier waves to establish a test-retest accuracy baseline. Initial analyses suggest the data are of high quality and show promise for constructing digital twins that predict human behavior well at the individual and aggregate levels. Beyond LLM applications, due to its unique breadth and scale, the data set also enables broad social science and business research, including studies of cross-construct correlations and heterogeneous treatment effects.},

    abstract = {While previously polarization was primarily seen only in issue-based terms, a new type of division has emerged in the mass public in recent years: Ordinary Americans increasingly dislike and distrust those from the other party. Democrats and Republicans both say that the other party’s members are hypocritical, selfish, and closed-minded, and they are unwilling to socialize across party lines. This phenomenon of animosity between the parties is known as affective polarization. We trace its origins to the power of partisanship as a social identity, and explain the factors that intensify partisan animus. We also explore the consequences of affective polarization, highlighting how partisan affect influences attitudes and behaviors well outside the political sphere. Finally, we discuss strategies that might mitigate partisan discord and conclude with suggestions for future work.},

This segmentation sorts brands into red products and blue products. Aggregating up to the firm-level, the partisan imbalance of an average firm’s consumer base increases in the earlier years but plateau shortly thereafter. Additional analysis indicate that firms respond to heightened product partisanship by offering products that appeal to both political factions as increased partisanship correlates with reduced firm profitability.},

    abstract = {The present article presents a meta-analytic test of intergroup contact theory. With 713 independent samples from 515 studies, the meta-analysis finds that intergroup contact typically reduces intergroup prejudice. Multiple tests indicate that this finding appears not to result from either participant selection or publication biases, and the more rigorous studies yield larger mean effects. These contact effects typically generalize to the entire outgroup, and they emerge across a broad range of outgroup targets and contact settings. Similar patterns also emerge for samples with racial or ethnic targets and samples with other targets. This result suggests that contact theory, devised originally for racial and ethnic encounters, can be extended to other groups. A global indicator of Allport’s optimal contact conditions demonstrates that contact under these conditions typically leads to even greater reduction in prejudice. Closer examination demonstrates that these conditions are best conceptualized as an interrelated bundle rather than as independent factors. Further, the meta-analytic findings indicate that these conditions are not essential for prejudice reduction. Hence, future work should focus on negative factors that prevent intergroup contact from diminishing prejudice as well as the development of a more comprehensive theory of intergroup contact.},
